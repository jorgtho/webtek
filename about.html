      <h1> About</h1>

        <p>Wingsuits is a band based in Trondheim. The band consists of the twins Herman (drums) and Haavard (guitar), Isak (guitar), Fredrik (bass), and Jørgen (vocals). They play music in the genre indie/pop/rock, which was decided by Herman and Haavard's dog, Oskar. Oskar is the band's manager, and he demands high quality on everything they do. Everyone in the band is also students in Trondheim (except Herman, he is a workaholic in Oslo), so they all have a backup plan for when Oskar quits as manager and splits up the band. It is foretold that he will do this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Four of the members first met in Ulsteinvik, out on the west coast of Norway in 2014. Three of them started playing together, but they were still missing vocals and bass. The legends say that one foggy day in Trondheim, Isak was sitting in his apartment, drinking coffee, when suddenly a person appeared in his coffee cup. This was Fredrik, and he was molded out of pure caffein that day, and emerged out of the coffee with a bass in his hands. Isak knew right there and then that he was going to play in a band with Fredrik. Some weeks after they found Jørgen on the streets of Trondheim, and he joined the band. Together, they formed the band Wingsuits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the following years, they have released an EP and several singles, played concerts all over the country (except in the north, Oskar won't let them go there for some reason), and wherever they played, good times followed.</p>
