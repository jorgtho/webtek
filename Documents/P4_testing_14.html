       <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
       <p>We did our testing following Tognazzinis 10 testing principles. We introduced ourselves,
          the task we had been given and how the test would be conducted. We explained they could at any time
          withdraw from the test if they felt the need. Further we told them the importance of thinking out loud,
          as this part of the testing precedure is crucial for us to get information from. We also gave them
          examples of how to think out loud. Then we told them that any difficulties they might have completing
          the presented tasks is a fault of the website, not them as test subjects. We presented them the option
          of asking questions before we started the test, and gave them the opportunity to make remarks after the test.</p>
       <h3>Tasks</h3>
       <p>The tasks in Norwegian, as presented to the test subjects. Designed to test each of the HTML pages.</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Oppgave 1: Finn menyen</li>
          <li>Oppgave 2: Finn ut hvor mye det koster å kjøpe en gul wingsuit-genser</li>
          <li>Oppgave 3: Finn billettprisen til Wingsuits sin konsert på Olavskvartalet</li>
          <li>Oppgave 4: Finn info om bandet Wingsuits og bla deg igjennom to bilder på bildeshowet</li>
          <li>Oppgave 5: Hør på musikkvideoen til Wingsuits</li>
          <li>Oppgave 6: Finn Facebook kontaktinfoen til Wingsuits</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Tested Audience</h3>
       <p>All test subjects were students, or in the same age-group as students. This is also the websites main
          target audience. In an optimal testing procedure we would also have liked to test a couple of around
          50 year old persons, as the bands parents likely also would want to visit the webpage.</p>

       <h3>Tested Platforms</h3>
       <p>We have tested the website on different computers, a mobile phone and a tablet. The different computers
          have had the operating systems mac OS and Microsoft Windows respectively with the browsers Safari and
          Chrome. The cellphone we tested on was an iPhone and the tablet was an iPad.</p>

       <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
       <p>The test subjects navigated through the site easily, and we found few errors during the testing. We got
          feedback from the users that the website had a good flow with the animations and a logical structure,
          and that it looked aesthetically pleasing in all the different formats. They liked the content of the
          page, and easily found the information they were looking for. On the other hand we discovered a couple
          errors during the testing. The first error is the fact that you couldn’t scroll down on the menu from
          the home page, and the second the fact that you can’t play a youtube video directly on a website from
          your phone. In addition we got feedback that some of the testers didn’t feel that a plus sign was an
          intuitive symbol for a menu and that they rather wished that it would just say “menu”, in spite of the
          fact that all the subjects pressed the plus sign first when they were looking for the menu. All in all
          we got a lot of positive feedback, and the users had virtually no trouble with the site.</p>

       <h2>Our Response</h2>
       <p>After discovering the error with the menu, we fixed it by making sure the user can scroll down and see
          the whole menu on all devices. When it comes to the youtube-video not playing we could have used a media
          query that only displayed an image instead of the video when the site was being used on a phone. We could
          also change the plus-icon to a button that just says menu so it’s easier for the users to understand that
          it’s a menu. Because of our limited time we have chosen to leave the page as it is now, but if we have
          had more time we could have implemented these changes.</p>

       <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
       <p>When reflecting upon the project and about what we have learned as a team, we found that our team's diverse competence
          was one of our biggest strengths. As three of us had some background in HTML, CSS, and JS, and one of the team members
          had a lot of experience in design, we managed to use and build upon each others strengths. Design issues were easily solved
          by double checking with or asking our "designer", and a quick discussion/question to the computer students often solved
          coding issues. The kind of "forced" division of the work also helped us by making sure every team member always knew what to do,
          and the deadline for doing it. Looking back, this both helped us save time in team meetings, and also made sure everyone got to 
          do their "fair share" of work. The fact that our client's contact person also was one of the team members might also have saved us
          some time, as it was relatively easy to get in contact with him. All in all, this project has not only helped us to learn how to create and
          design a website, but also given us insight in how to work effectively as a team, structure work, and meeting a client's requirements.</p>
