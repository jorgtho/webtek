     <li> Nan Nan would like to have her artwork displayed in sections. </li>
     <li> Nan Nan and Geir Henbest have specifically told us that they would like to

  <h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>
  
  <p>We plan to post many pictures in the gallery sections of our website, so we may 
  run into the technical problem regarding slowly-loading webpages. Such a website 
  will be frustrating for users, so we will need to make sure to avoid such a problem 
  by being conscious about the size and number of the photographs we use.
